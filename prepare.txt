-Functions that eliminates repetitions
-Prefer questions to manual writing
-Getters and Setters in Classes
-Namespaces in functions/method definitions
-Changing return values
-Creation of a class (with canonical form?)
-Documentation of code
-Replacment of variables
-Inclusion of a personal header
-etc..

Most needed functionalities:

-construction of a basic class with a pattern which can be modified in a file
-generation of getters and setters related to the protected and privates attributes (selection of the corresponding line with enter on each line, or multiple line while keeping a key)
-basic .cpp code corresponding to the header file;
-creation of basic Interfaces.
-auto update functions corresponding to the header's modifications.
-one big folder of config file (or even a GUI to configure that?)
